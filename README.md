### Dr Philip A. Shaw

#### Background

I am an academic specialist in historical linguistics and early Germanic languages. I completed my first degree at the University of Oxford before undertaking a PhD at the University of Leeds. I did my postdoctoral work on an electronic edition of a medieval French romance and have held academic posts at the universities of Sheffield, Leicester and Durham. My publications include two research monographs and numerous peer-reviewed articles.

#### Current Work

My research at the moment focusses on areas of historical linguistics including the human body and landscape terminology, and I am also working on the application of cluster analysis to understanding the naming patterns of Domesday Book landholders.

#### Future Plans

I am currently working on developing potential new career avenues in software development, with a particular interest in NLP. My future research plans include work on the application of machine learning to the analysis of landscape morphology and terminology in the early Germanic languages.
